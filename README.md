# alineR
alineR is an R package by Sean Downey and Guowei Sun that makes available Kondrak's _aline_ algorithm. _aline_ is a phonetic feature-based word similarity score developed by Grzegorz Kondrak, Copyrighted 2015.

Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance between words as per (Kondrak 2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox, Norquest, & Lansing, 2008, <doi:10.1080/09296170802326681>). The score is based on phonetic features represented using the Unicode-compliant International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized features weights are used to determine the optimal alignment and functions are provided to estimate optimum values using a genetic algorithm and supervised learning.
