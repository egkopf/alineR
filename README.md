alineR as developed by Greg Kondrak, Sean Downey and Guowei Sun. Copyrighted 2015.
Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance between words as per (Kondrak 2000) and (Downey, Hallmark, Cox, Norquest, & Lansing, 2008, <doi:10.1080/09296170802326681>). The score is based on phonetic features represented using the Unicode-compliant International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized features weights are used to determine the optimal alignment and functions are provided to estimate optimum values using a genetic algorithm and supervised learning. See (Downey, Sun, and Norquest 2017, <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-005/index.html>.
